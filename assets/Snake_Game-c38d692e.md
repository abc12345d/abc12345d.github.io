# Snake Game
A classic Snake game empowered by Python.

---

This code is a Python script that runs a simple Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. The game allows the player to control a snake on the screen, collecting food to increase its length while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- main.py:
  - Initializes the game's main components such as the screen, snake, food, and scoreboard.
  - Contains a start_game() function that controls the game loop and the logic for updating the snake's movement, detecting collisions, and managing user input.
  - Sets up the screen and its properties, then listens for the "s_" key to start the game loop.
  - Exits the game when the screen is clicked.
- food.py:
  - Defines a Food class that represents the food the snake collects. 
  - Contains a refresh() method that randomly positions the food on the screen.
- snake.py:
  - Defines the Snake class that represents the snake the player controls.
  - Contains methods for moving the snake, controlling its direction, detecting collisions with itself and walls, and adding segments.
- scoreboard.py:
  - Defines the Scoreboard class that manages and displays the game's score.
  - Contains methods for updating the score, increasing the score, retrieving the highest score from a file, resetting the score and etc.

Each module (main.py, food.py, snake.py, scoreboard.py) contributes to a specific aspect of the game's functionality, resulting in a classic Snake game.
