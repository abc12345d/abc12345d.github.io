# When to use Hash table?
When we need to quickly determine whether an element appears in a collection, we should consider hashing. By using Hash Tables, we can get access time of O(1).

However, the hashing method also sacrifices space for time, because we have to use additional arrays, sets or maps to store data in order to achieve fast lookups.
